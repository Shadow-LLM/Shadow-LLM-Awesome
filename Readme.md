# Shadow-LLM-Awesome

## Introduction
Welcome to `shadow-LLM-Awesome`, a curated collection of resources, research papers, articles, and discussions focused on instances where Large Language Models (LLMs) demonstrate behaviors that do not align with human values. This repository aims to support researchers, ethicists, and technologists in understanding and addressing the ethical, societal, and technical challenges posed by LLMs.

## Objective
The primary goal of this repository is to:
- Collect and organize instances where LLMs have deviated from human ethical standards or societal norms.
- Provide a platform for discussions and research that aim to improve the alignment of LLMs with human values.
- Foster awareness and understanding of the potential risks and challenges associated with LLM technologies.
